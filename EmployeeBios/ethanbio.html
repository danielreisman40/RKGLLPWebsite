            <section id="introduction">

                <p>Ethan Greene, a founding partner of the firm, focuses on the resolution of mass tort and complex litigation.  He has successfully negotiated and implemented settlements of pharmaceutical, medical device, and other product liability litigation through traditional resolution methods (such as settlements of individual cases through mediation) as well through innovative approaches to aggregate and class action settlements to resolve tens of thousands of cases.  He has experience developing methodologies to allocate aggregate settlement funds amongst hundreds of participating claimants in a fair, efficient, and transparent manner.  He has worked in a variety of roles, including as counsel for individual clients, as a court-appointed Special Master in federal and state courts, and as an independent, third-party neutral selected by private parties.  He also counsels clients on compliance with the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, and has developed lien resolution processes to protect plaintiffs and defendants while efficiently resolving liens in large scale settlements. </p>
